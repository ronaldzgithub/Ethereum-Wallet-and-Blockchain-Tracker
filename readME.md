# Ethereum Wallet and Blockchain Explorer

A terminal application in Python which pulls data from the Ethereum Blockchain and etherscan.io API. Tracking any single walletâ€™s data history and the live/historical information of the entire blockchain presented in MatPlotLib.

## Description

As you might have guessed by looking at my other projects I am quite interested in the Crypto sphere. Not so much the currencies, more so the technology. So I set about making a nice little project to navigate the land of Ethereum. My inital plan was to download the entire Ethereum blockchain, throw it into a database and navigate it from there. Sadly, the Ethereum blockchain is almost 250gb in size and I don't really have that storage freely sitting about.

So I found some APIs which allowed me to abstract me downloading the entire chain away.

My application has way way way less functionality than the Etherscan.io and the like. But that doesn't matter, I learnt a fair bit about extracting and manipulating data from APIs etc.

In future updates I might make it so you can save output data to a file. Yet to be decided.

## Help

The etherscan API has a pro/paid tier which is needed for the program to fully run.. I'm too stingy at the moment to pay
